### Employee and Manager

Write a class `Employee` that has attributes that return the
employee's name, title, salary, and boss.

Write another class, `Manager`, that extends `Employee`. `Manager`
should have an attribute that holds an array of all employees assigned
to the manager. Note that managers might report to higher level
managers, of course.

Add a method, `bonus(multiplier)` to `Employee`. Non-manager employees
should get a bonus like this

    bonus = (employee salary) * multiplier

Managers should get a bonus based on the total salary of all of their
subordinates, as well as the manager's subordinates' subordinates, and
the subordinates' subordinates' subordinates, etc.

    bonus = (total salary of all sub-employees) * multiplier

#### Testing

If we have a company structured like this:

| Name    | Salary      | Title       | Boss    |
|-------- |------------ |------------ |-------- |
| Rachell | $1,000,000  | Founder     | nil     |
| Jin     | $78,000     | Manager     | Rachell |
| Hassan  | $12,000     | Coach       | Jin     |
| Sujin   | $10,000     | Coach       | Jin     |

then we should have bonuses like this:

```python
rachell.bonus(5) == 500000
jin.bonus(4) == 88000
sujin.bonus(3) == 30000
```
